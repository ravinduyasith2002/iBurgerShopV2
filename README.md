# 🍔 BurgerShop V2 - Java Swing Application

This is a Java Swing-based desktop application designed to manage the core operations of a burger shop, including placing, updating, and searching orders. The application focuses on performance, clean design, and object-oriented best practices.

## 📚 Brief Introduction

BurgerShop V2 is a refined version of a previously built Java Swing project. In this version:

* A custom **List data structure using Nodes** is implemented to handle dynamic order data.
* A fully **encapsulated controller class** (`BurgerShopController`) handles all order-related logic.
* The project is fully developed in **NetBeans IDE** for better GUI management.
* Key order attributes include `orderId`, `customerId` (phone number), `customerName`, `orderQuantity`, and `orderStatus`.
* Emphasis is placed on clean logic, not boilerplate: **no logic was AI-generated** — all implementations were self-developed with only minor syntax reference support.
